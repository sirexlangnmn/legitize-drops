                                              Most of your activity in the Enkronos subreddit should be comments, but threads are also accepted. Keeping the discussion active is more important than posting the same thread over and over.

                                             Spamming a subreddit will not help the Bounty Campaign and will do more harm than good, resulting in the removal of your entry.

                                             Threads with a high amount of upvotes but close to 0 comments will be deemed as (obviously) fake and not taken into consideration. Your thread should have 10% of your upvotes as comments (rounded up), so, a thread with 15 upvotes should have 2 comments, a thread with 30 upvotes should have 3 coments, etc.
